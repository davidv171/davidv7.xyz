# Parasocial relationships and the line that was never drawn

What are parasocial relationships:



```
Parasocial relationships are one-sided relationships, where one person extends emotional energy, interest and time, and the other party, the persona, is completely unaware of the otherâ€™s existence. Parasocial relationships are most common with celebrities, organizations (such as sports teams) or television stars.


```

I will be focusing on a small, but very successful subset of Twitch streamers.
I should point out, that most streamers do not have the criminal mastermind
levels of genius required to plan any of this, nor do they
subconsciously exhibit these behaviors out of malice.

## The scenario

A long time ago, a clip got posted to a subreddit I follow:

Person donates to Streamer(around $20), mentioning that they're in a very hard
spot now psychologically, thanking them for being of assistance.

The streamer thanks the donation like everything else, and moves on.

The comments though, were less kind, and pretty eye opening. The person that
donated got criticized harshly for seeking attention with a streamer on such
matters. The streamer is not your shrink. That is very important.

However, the streamer is one of those personality streamers that thrives off of parasocial
relationship content. A person going through a tough time, and sinking into
parasocial behavior will at some point treat the streamer like a real friend.
And there is nothing wrong with venting about your feelings to a real friend, right? 

While to us, such behavior is just odd and unhealthy, they are the target of the
streamer. Exactly the type of personality that brings a streamer's revenue
numbers up by a lot, so they can afford a new car they don't tell their
community about. 

## The hypocrisy

Streamers are benefiting greatly from parasocial relationships, in terms of
financial well-being. Some people directly donate large amounts, others just
advertise them for free. But when the parasocial relationship crosses a
completely imaginary line, only one party in this mutual relationship is then chastised.

Really makes you think. Both parties need to start being held accountable for
this unnatural and dangerous relationship.
